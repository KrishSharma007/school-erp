# Routing Troubleshooting Guide

## Current Status
The routing fix is not working. Let's try multiple solutions.

## Solution 1: Try Different Vercel Configurations

### Option A: Use only `vercel.json` with routes
```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/about",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/contact",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/gallery",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/facilities",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/academics",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/admin",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Option B: Use only `vercel.json` with rewrites
```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Option C: Use only `_redirects` file
```
/* /index.html 200
```

## Solution 2: Check Vercel Project Settings

1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard**
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to Settings > General**
4. **Check "Framework Preset"** - should be "Vite"
5. **Check "Build Command"** - should be `npm run build`
6. **Check "Output Directory"** - should be `dist`

## Solution 3: Force Redeploy

1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard**
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to Deployments tab**
4. **Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment**
5. **Or create a new deployment by pushing changes**

## Solution 4: Check Deployment Logs

1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard**
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to Deployments tab**
4. **Click on the latest deployment**
5. **Check for any errors in the build logs**

## Solution 5: Test Locally First

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Preview the build
npm run preview

# Test these URLs in your browser:
# http://localhost:4173/about
# http://localhost:4173/contact
# http://localhost:4173/gallery
```

## Solution 6: Alternative Vercel Config

Try this alternative `vercel.json`:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**/*.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  },
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Solution 7: Check File Structure

Make sure your files are in the correct locations:
```
frontend-erp/
├── vercel.json          # In root directory
├── public/
│   └── _redirects      # In public directory
└── dist/               # Build output
    └── index.html
```

## Solution 8: Clear Vercel Cache

1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard**
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to Settings > General**
4. **Scroll down to "Build & Development Settings"**
5. **Click "Clear Cache"**

## Solution 9: Check Domain Configuration

If you have a custom domain:
1. **Go to your Vercel dashboard**
2. **Select your project**
3. **Go to Settings > Domains**
4. **Make sure the domain is properly configured**

## Solution 10: Try Different Approach

If nothing works, try this approach:

1. **Delete both `vercel.json` and `public/_redirects`**
2. **Create a new `vercel.json` with this content:**

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ],
  "headers": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "headers": [
        {
          "key": "Cache-Control",
          "value": "no-cache"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Testing Steps

After each change:

1. **Commit and push changes**
2. **Wait for Vercel to redeploy**
3. **Test these URLs:**
   - `https://your-domain.vercel.app/about`
   - `https://your-domain.vercel.app/contact`
   - `https://your-domain.vercel.app/gallery`

## Common Issues

- **Caching**: Vercel might cache old configurations
- **File location**: Files must be in the correct directories
- **Deployment time**: Sometimes it takes a few minutes
- **Build errors**: Check deployment logs for errors

## Next Steps

1. Try Solution 1 (different configurations)
2. If that doesn't work, try Solution 6 (alternative config)
3. If still not working, check deployment logs
4. Consider contacting Vercel support
